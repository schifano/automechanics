# Ch.1 - Introduction to the Automobile

*Design objective* - the specific job for the vehicle

Reducing cost of manufacturing

* change the method of production: forged, cast, stamping, sintered metal part, plastics for non structural parts, fiberglass
* engineering preferences based on previous satisfactory performance of design, until uneconomical or unpopular
	* ex: Ford's transverse spring

### 1-1 Vehicle Design

seat driver, passenger, load, engine power to move load, brake to stop, controllable

**Body and Frame**

* driver visibility, low noise level and vibration, seats to minimize fatigue

*Construction Methods*

1. Separate body and frame

	* Engine, drive line, running gear fastned to frame
	Body is mounted to the frame with insulators to minimize vibration transfer

2. Unitized

	* Frame is part of the body structure
	Body panels add strength to the frame pieces
	Running gear and drive line are attached with large soft insulators to minimize noise and vibration
	Requires careful insulation design -- too soft = spongy ride, too hard = improper insulation

3. Unitized body with stub front frame

	* Stub frame from fire wall forward and fire wall back
	Rigid, provides good insulation
	Generally applied to larger body styles

Summary: 

1. Small - unitized
2. Standard - separate body and frame
3. Large - body with stub front frame

*Engines*

1. Front - domestic application

	* Provide most room for occupants
	* Safety factor in head-on collision
	* Placement of cooling radiator at front with min of ducting and hoses

2. Midship

3. Rear

Engine Types:

1. Gasoline
2. Diesel

	* Used in taxicab fleets, Europe (more expensive gas) because it uses less fuel at lower speeds than gasoline

3. Turbine

	* Powerful, lightweight, low on harmful emissions
	
*Drive Line*

Also known as a drive train <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain>


# Shafts, Bearings, and Oil Seals

Major rotating parts:

* crankshaft
* camshaft

Power from expanding gases in the combustion chamber is delivered to the crankshaft through the piston, piston pin, and connecting rod.
